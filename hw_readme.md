#  HW Readme

End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often have difficulty recognizing uncommon words, that appear infrequently in the training data. One promising method, to improve the recognition accuracy on such rare words, is to latch onto personalized/contextual information at inference.In this work, we present a novel approach that we can use Keyword prefix tree Search in BeamSearch.
